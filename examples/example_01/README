Example 1 :  Train C60 molecule energy differences and atomic forces

Note (1): Each structure in geo file corresponds to a rigid C60 with a different bond length for a specified pair of atoms (i.e. bond scan).
Note (2): We do not use here geometry relaxation for all the other atoms to save CPU time (0 imaxit in control file). If we did, then we had to define bond restraints
          for the pair of atoms we are stretching (to hold them in place during geometry relaxation). If needed, restraints can be defined in the geo 
          file. See standalone reaxff manual. In addition, 'imaxit' keyword in control file will need to change to any value larger than 0. 
Note (3): Since we are using a relatively small training set (not many structures), we do not split the training set over sub-units (no training set parallelization).
          Thus, the only parallelization is over swarm members (each swarm runs on a different CPU if #members=#requested cpus)
          For large training sets, we can include training set parallelization in inp_flocky.in file. In this mode, the training set (and structures) are shared
          among M swarm members of which #1, #2, ... #M-1, #M are the helper members of swarm member #0 (independent member). 
          Hence, to split a training set by 4, with a total of 32 swarm members: M=4, swarm members=32 ==> independent members = 32/4 = 8. Each independent member
          will have a different set of training parameters (i.e. a different force field candidate).
Note (4): We do not perform a local minimization for the cost function (since RiPSOGM includes some local search behaviour already), however including rigorous
          local minimization may help for particularly noisy cost functions. We can choose between Nelder-Mead or LBFGS (with numerical derivatives).

Description of input files

1. ffield = ReaxFF force field file (standard or lg type)
2. geo = BIOGRF file with coordinates of training set structures. Format sensitive. 
3. fbgf/*.fbgf = BIOGRF files with coordinates of atomic forces for a structure described by the filename (has to correspond the same name in geo file)
4. control = various control settings for Tapered ReaxFF
5. inp_flocky.in = control settings for flocky
6. params = specification of training parameters and their bounds. parameters are specified by their absolute line and column values in ffield file.
7. batch = standard slurm batch script for submitting flocky tasks under HPC platform
8. trainset.in = training set file
9. tapreaxff = Tapered ReaxFF executable needs to be present in the working directory
